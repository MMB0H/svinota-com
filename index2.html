        <p>The Scottish Fold is a breed of domestic cat with a natural dominant gene mutation that affects cartilage throughout the body, causing the ears to "fold", bending forward and down towards the front of the head, which gives the cat what is often described as an "owl-like" appearance. Originally called lop-eared or lops after the lop-eared rabbit, Scottish Fold became the breed's name in 1966. Depending on registries, longhaired Scottish Folds are varyingly known as Highland Fold, Scottish Fold Longhair, Longhair Fold and Coupari.</p>
        <h3>A bit of history:</h3>
        <p>The original Scottish Fold was a white barn cat named Susie, who was found at a farm near Coupar Angus in Perthshire, Scotland, in 1961. Susie's ears had an unusual fold in their middle, making her resemble an owl. When Susie had kittens, two of them were born with folded ears, and one was acquired by William Ross, a neighbouring farmer and cat-fancier. Ross registered the breed with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in the United Kingdom in 1966 and started to breed Scottish Fold kittens with the help of geneticist Pat Turner.The breeding program produced 76 kittens in the first three years – 42 with folded ears and 34 with straight ears. The conclusion from this was that the ear mutation is due to a simple dominant gene. Susie's only reproducing offspring was a female Fold named Snooks who was also white; a second kitten was neutered shortly after birth. Three months after Snooks' birth, Susie was killed by a car. All Scottish Fold cats share a common ancestry to Susie.</p>
        <h3>Phisical characteristics</h3>
        <p>The Scottish Fold is a medium to large sized cat, which can come in any color, even calico. Males typically weigh 4–6 kg, and females weigh 2.7–4 kg. She is a very round looking cat. The head is round and the folded ears heighten that illusion of roundness. The Fold's entire body structure, especially the head and face, is generally rounded, and the eyes large and round. The nose is short with a gentle curve, and the cat's body is well-rounded with a padded look and medium-to-short legs. The head is domed at the top, and the neck very short. The broadly-spaced eyes give the Scottish Fold a "sweet expression". The scottish fold's ears are folded hence the name "Scottish Fold".</p>
        <h3>Coat</h3>
        <p>Scottish Folds can be either long- or short-haired, and they may have nearly any coat color or combination of colours (including white). Shorthair Scottish Folds have thick and soft fur, with longhair Folds having longer and exceptionally dense fur around their upper thighs, toes, ears, and tail. The short coat is easy to care for. Some registries allow a longhaired version of the Scottish Fold called the Scottish Fold Longhair. Their longer coats can vary slightly in texture, and require regular care. Scottish Folds can be either long- or short-haired, and they may have nearly any coat color or combination of colours (including white).</p>
        <h3>Temperament</h3>
        <p>The Scottish Fold is a sweet, charming breed. She is an easy cat to live with and to care for. She is affectionate and is comfortable with all members of her family. Her tail should be handled gently. Some of these cats are known to develop stiffness in the tail that can cause pain if it is mishandled or accidentally handled in a rough manner. Scottish Folds, whether with folded ears or with normal ears, are typically good-natured and placid and adjust to other animals within a household extremely well. They tend to become very attached to their human caregivers and are by nature quite affectionate. Folds also receive high marks for playfulness, grooming and intelligence. Scottish Folds like to be outdoors and enjoy outdoor games and activities. Loneliness is something they heavily dislike.</p>
        <h3>Habits</h3>
        <p>Folds are also known for sleeping on their backs. Scottish Folds typically have soft voices and display a complex repertoire of meows and purrs not found in better-known breeds. Folds are also known for sitting with their legs stretched out and their paws on their belly. This position is called the "Buddha Position".</p>
        <h3>Health</h3>
        <p>The typical lifespan of a Scottish Fold is 15 years. Scottish folds are susceptible to polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and cardiomyopathy. Scottish folds are also prone to degenerative joint disease (a type of arthritis), most commonly affecting the tail, ankles, and knees which can result in reduced range of motion. The Scottish Fold breed of cat has a genetic mutation that affects the development of cartilage. The most obvious outward manifestation of this is making the ear cartilage fold so the ears bend forward, giving the cat its characteristic appearance.</p>
