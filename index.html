       <p>The British Shorthair has a broad chest, muscular neck, strong jaws
         and a well developed muzzle. The legs are thick and strong. The breed
         looks like what she originally was, a cat that was to keep rodents out
         of the barn and the house. The coat of the British is thick and dense.</p>
         <p>British Shorthairs are good, calm pets for families once they move
           past their kitten stage. They are affectionate, intelligent and trainable
           and will bond closely with their families. They usually get along with
           well-behaved children. Once bonded, British Shorthairs generally like
           to be around their humans.</p>
