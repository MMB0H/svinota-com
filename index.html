       <p style="font-size: 24px; text-transform: uppercase; font-style: italic;">Welcome to my internet page with me, happy cat <strong>pixel</strong>.</p>

       <p style="color: orange; font-size: 30px;">The Scottish Fold is seemingly made
         entirely of curves! This rounded, medium sized cat is compact and solid, with a
         round head, large round eyes and most notably their ears are small and neatly
         folded forward covering the ear opening. The Scottish Fold has a sweet expression
         and a luxurious short, dense coat.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Scottish Folds, whether with folded ears
          or with normal ears, are typically good-natured and placid and adjust
          to other animals within a household extremely well. They tend to become
          very attached to their human caregivers and are by nature quite affectionate.
          Folds also receive high marks for playfulness, grooming and intelligence.
          Scottish Folds like to be outdoors and enjoy outdoor games and activities.
          Loneliness is something they heavily dislike. It is also common
          for Scottish Folds to be stubborn.</p>
